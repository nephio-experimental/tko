TKO
===

A PoC demonstrating scalability opportunities for Nephio with a focus on decoupling the various
subsystems, specifically the data backend and orchestration logic plugins, as well as integration
with external site inventories and blueprint catalogs.

TKO can also be automated using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks. Included is a demo
based on [Ansible AWX](https://www.ansible.com/awx/) (a.k.a. Ansible Tower).

This PoC is a complete rewrite of the Nephio core. It comprises three controllers (Data, Preparer,
and Meta-Scheduler) that can run independently or be embedded into a control plane. Included
is first-class support for using a Kubernetes management cluster as the control plane.

For the data backend, the default is RDBMS, optimized for the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
dialect of SQL. RDBMSes provides scalability, reliability, resiliency, and atomic updates via
transactions. They are widely available as managed cloud services, e.g. Google's planetary-scale
[Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner) (which also speaks the PostgreSQL dialect).

A git data backend is also possible (a.k.a. "GitOps"), but not currently included. Note that such
a backend may be suitable for storing templates, but it's probably not a good backend for sites and
deployments, which are expected to number in the millions in real-world telco environments.

The TKO data controller exposes three flavors of API:

1) [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), which is widely supported, including in loadbalancers (see
   [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/other_protocols/grpc))
   and thus service meshes. TKO makes good use of gRPC streaming directly from the backend to
   the clients, allowing scalable access to extremely large result sets.
2) KRM via a Kubernetes aggregated API. When running in a Kubernetes management cluster, it may
   be preferrable for controllers to use KRM instead of gRPC, though the latter is still readily
   available inside Kubernetes. Note that this KRM API is *not* implemented as CRs and is *not*
   stored in Kubernetes's etcd database. Rather, it's a KRM facade over the TKO backend.
3) A simple JSON-over-HTTP API for web browser applications, such as GUIs.

Ways in which TKO differs from Nephio:

* A different approach to "specialization" (here called "preparation"), replacing the
  [kpt](https://kpt.dev/) file with per-resource plugins: no pipeline, no conditions.
  Enforces atomic updates. Kpt functions still get first-class support.
* A different approach to "instantiation" based on meta-scheduling of complete sites
  together with *all* their associated workload deployments, including infrastructure
  resources for infrastructure managers. Can work with existing sites and also provision
  new ones.
* A different approach to topologies, incorporating topology decomposition as part of the
  preparation process. Topologies can be nested. Also supports
  [TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tosca/) topologies as an alternative frontend,
  implemented with [Puccini](https://github.com/tliron/puccini).
* A different approach to KRM validation, supporting custom validation plugins that can
  go far beyond OpenAPIv3 schemas. Can also work on templates via "partial" validation. Invalid
  KRM is *never* allowed into the backend. Relies on
  [Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) for validating standard Kubernetes
  resources via their published OpenAPIv3 schemas.

Additional features demonstrated:

* SDK for Python-based plugins for preparation, meta-scheduling, and validation. The SDK
  does most of heavy lifting, allowing devs to focus on the network function or cloud
  platform vendor logic.
* Rich metadata support, enabling powerful and scalable package querying and template/site
  selection for topologies.
* Support for [Helm](https://helm.sh/) charts with an expression language for pulling in
  chart input values (as an alternative to full-blown preparation plugins).
* Web dashboard.
* Rich terminal dashboard, with mouse support.
* IPv6 first, with support for dual-stack IP.
* Unified structured logging via [CommonLog](https://github.com/tliron/commonlog),
  including support for logging to journald.
